		This website is the geoportfolio of Dalvir Heyer which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOM2116). The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		I'm Dalvir Heyer, a brief introduction about myself is that I am from Melbourne, Australia and as of September 2023, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course. My geospatial-related interests is working with remote sensing data, collection and analysis of
		aerial-captured imagery, distribution modelling and creating 3D generations of models using spatial data. My current geospatial major projects is looking into 
		Changing Population patterns across the Metropolitan Melbourne Area. The project undertaken involves use of GIS tools and techniques and geography

	<div class="academic-intro">
		During my time studing geospatial sciecne at RMIT, I have learned about the geospatial and surveying industries. With classes using and understanding 
		different types of GIS tecnhiques. My studies have involved cartography, remote sensing, GIS analysis, environmental analysis and working with spatial data.
		With a recent class in professional in the workplace I have been given a great stepping stone to understand and begin working in the geospatial industry.
		<ul>
			<li>During my time at RMIT I have completed many different types of projects. I will display some of the projects on the site.</li>
			<li>While completing Cartography and GIS classes I have been given free rein on producing any map I want, and publishing my work online. </li>
			<li>Below are some of the GIS and Cartography project I have completed.</li>

		Below are projects and assessments I have undertaken while studying at RMIT. While studying I have completed many different types of geospatial related such as remote-sensing,
		GIS analysis, scanning and field measurements. The following projects shown will involve analysis and data collection to create features. Programs used to complete involves using
		ArcGIS and QGIS. Both programs have similair features and a great to find and show analysis. 
		<ul>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Below is a data capture project I completed involving trees. I assessment required was to use our mobile device to record the approximate coordinates of the tress captured. Then 
			input the coordinates in QGIS and assess whether the coordinates are accurate to the true location. From this the tress are displayed on QGIS with the 
			approximate height, canopy spread and trunk size.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2023) within the geospatial science and surveting industry. While stuyding at RMIT I have 
		been working as an assistant surveyor at Kirby Land Surveying.

		While studying at RMIT I have been working at Kirby Land Surevying as an assistant surveyor. Working I have worked on many different types of surevying jobs such as:
		feature and level surevys, set-outs, subdivison works and re-establishment surevys. Working in the industry has allowed me to gain knowledge and development while 
		co-asding with my studies. Getting that experience to work in teams and learn from others is in my professional great development. 
		<p>
		As part of my role I am using surevying equipment such as the Trimble total station and controller. My role also includes setting up backsights, remembering and stroing 
		points and codes, mainting equipment and assistaning the lead surveyor. What I enjoy about the industry is that there is a different job everyday and there is not the same 
		job twice. Another benefits are travelling around Melbourne and Victoria.
